## **Contribution Guidelines:**
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

#### We Use the fork-and-pull method, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:
  - Fork the repo to your account.
  - clone the repo into your local directory using **git clone** in your git bash.
  - Make your changes and test it locally on your code editor
  - **commit** your changes and **push** your work back to your fork
  - Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes.


## The Web Application uses :

  - HTML & CSS
  - Bootstrap
  - PHP & sql

## On Task Completion:

  - Push Changes
  - Create Pull Request
  - Add Reviewer to Pull Request
